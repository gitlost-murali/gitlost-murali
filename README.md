<!--- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently building an open-source tool to leverage recent advances in NLP for data labelling, augmentation.-->

About me:

- T-shaped ML engineer. _Deployed a highly scalable ML application that helps ecologists in detecting bird migration patterns. Scalable upto 400 nodes._ 
- ðŸ”­ Data Scientist with research interests in NLP. _Worked on a deidentification project in Healthcare. Explored different augmentation & annotation techniques to smoothen the process. Always interested in improving under-resource setting._
<!--- - ðŸš€ Optimized a 20B parameter model-->
<!--- - ðŸŒ± I dedicate this year(Sep 2024 - 25) to be an End-to-End Data Scientist, good at Software Engineering practices, System Design, MLOps(Kubernetes, etc) & [Blogging](https://gitlost-murali.github.io/blogs/).-->
- ðŸŒ± I dedicate this year(Sep 2024 - 25) to dive deep into core neural network concepts like Writing Custom Kernels, Implementing models in performance heavy languages like Rust, (well learning Rust along the way) & [Blogging](https://gitlost-murali.github.io/blogs/).
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about NLP/ML/any recent news.
